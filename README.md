A quick hello and instructions on getting access to private demo repos


Hello recruiters and hiring managers!
I have several sample projects that can be shared upon request.
- A Dockerized Rust API server with a postman test app.
- A Maven managed Java-Selenium-Cucumber Web App test with gherkin feature file.
- Others coming soon (A perl based API Fuzzer is next in the pipeline, a demo version will be available)

Additionally in the publicly shared repos there are some of my fun Perl applications.
Some of these may need some massaging to work on an arbitrary system, they each demonstrate areas where perl can be well suited:
- Mechanical Turk testing of actions (the markov chain generator)
- Lan interfacing of test harnesses in a CLI environment along with automated test dispatch to available remote units (the perl BBS)
- code generation tools

And finally the science fair project of the MEBx screen reader.  This was an excercize to see if it could be done.  Image capture was via VNC session with a remote lan based KVM.  

While I would love to share some other projects, that code is too specific to former employers and I respect their IP the same way I will respect yours :)
